					<p>Two years ago, I saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwneRb-zqA">video from Sebastian Lague</a> about how computers work. This is a problem I've thought about a good amount. How do we go from a dumb rock to a computer? There are a lot of middle steps, and studying physics, I've learned about a lot of them, but I think one of the least explored in a public-facing way is how we get from logic to computers. In particular, I was asked about this by a mathematician friend of mine and I realized any explanation I could give in words wouldn't be clear. That was the genesis of this game idea. Since then, I have worked on it occasionally during my time as a PhD student. Each time I come back to it, I know more, I'm a better programmer, and more importantly, the underlying engine <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> is updated every three months or so, often with breaking changes. Becouse of this, i have rewritten this game to one degree or another four times now. This website, and these devlogs are here to keep me honest, and help me avoid the "rewrite it in rust" meme on this version. In the next few weeks, I'll have a file for you to download to play around with the basic mechanics, until then, listen to the borrow checker!</p>
